Product Operations Overview

This section delineates the operational frameworks of the product, encompassing both hardware and software components.

For the iKiosk component, the operational functionality is encapsulated within meticulously crafted programs. The Arduino Uno sketch, composed in the C++ programming language, orchestrates the hardware operations. It intricately manages the low and high frequency functionalities of the buzzer, temperature readings from the MLX90614 sensor, RFID tag identification via the MFRC522 module, and data presentation on the LCD display. Moreover, the Visual Studio CS files, composed in C#, govern the database connectivity and WinForms user interface of the kiosk. These files embody the algorithmic blueprint for the iKioskâ€™s user interface, pivotal for efficient data management within the Firebase project, encompassing functionalities for data retrieval and storage.

As for the iKiosk App and Triage App components, a judicious selection of code segments has been curated to elucidate the core operational mechanisms. Both applications, developed for the Android platform in Kotlin, are unified under a single Firebase project. In this section, a succinct portrayal of the essential components is provided, shedding light on the fundamental operational paradigms. To facilitate comprehension of the iKiosk App's functionality, pertinent artifacts such as the Android manifest, sign-up and sign-in activities, home navigation, article browsing, user profile management, contact tracing module, temperature monitoring interface, settings configuration, COVID overview dashboard, and basic information retrieval mechanisms are outlined. Likewise, for the Triage App, the technical exposition encompasses the Android manifest, sign-in process, home screen navigation, temperature report generation, and requisite data models and adapters.

This comprehensive breakdown offers a cogent understanding of the operational intricacies of each component, facilitating seamless comprehension and utilization.
